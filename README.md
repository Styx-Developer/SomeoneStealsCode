While this percentage might seem low, its because not everything was stolen, and we do have different code practices, since the base of my script, is my own, and not Wrath Admin. To further add to my point, you can view the next imagine, which will show that this script was entirely stolen off Wrath based on a guy who was arguing with me over this.
